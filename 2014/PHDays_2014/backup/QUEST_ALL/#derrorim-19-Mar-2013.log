Mar 19 12:30:32 <Paul_Axe>	they are very skilled hackers, but most of them work in the University
Mar 19 12:30:48 <Paul_Axe>	they are generous and too kind, we could use it

Mar 19 12:33:28 <Paul_Axe>	well-known Spanish team
Mar 19 12:35:46 <Paul_Axe>	don't know much about them, but most of them use Macbooks
Mar 19 12:36:03 <Paul_Axe>	I've seen then on some CTF
Mar 19 12:36:46 <lordofhaskel>	he-he... they seem to like apples
Mar 19 12:36:51 <Paul_Axe>	does this help?
Mar 19 12:37:31 <lordofhaskel>	yeah, I'll think about some motivation-layer algorithms)
Mar 19 12:37:36 <Paul_Axe>	gr8
Mar 19 12:37:45 <Paul_Axe>	next is ReallyNonamesFor
Mar 19 12:38:03 <Paul_Axe>	pretty new team from Moscow
Mar 19 12:42:04 <Paul_Axe>	I know one of their guys, Betepok

Mar 19 12:42:39 <Paul_Axe>	yeah, kinda
Mar 19 12:43:15 <Paul_Axe>	people usually pronounce it wrong
Mar 19 12:43:47 <Paul_Axe>	he is a nice guy, actually
Mar 19 12:44:09 <lordofhaskel>	=\ I can imagine only one way to pronounce it
Mar 19 12:45:02 <lordofhaskel>	well... fuck it.. what's next?
Mar 19 12:45:10 <Paul_Axe>	Plaid Parliament of Pwning aka PPP
Mar 19 12:45:26 <lordofhaskel>	yeah, I heard about them
Mar 19 12:45:36 <lordofhaskel>	from USA?
Mar 19 12:46:08 <Paul_Axe>	yep. those guys are tough
Mar 19 12:46:53 <Paul_Axe>	but there is a bunch of things about them
Mar 19 12:48:45 <Paul_Axe>	I heard, they always take some handcrafted computer with them. Some people think it is some kind of AI that helps them to hack
Mar 19 12:49:34 <Paul_Axe>	but I think it is just a gateway to connect to the Google datacenter and bruteforce everything
Mar 19 12:49:59 <lordofhaskel>	hmm... I doubt that we are able to bring their AI to D'Errorim)
Mar 19 12:50:05 <Paul_Axe>	I also heard that geohot plays with them
Mar 19 12:51:21 <Paul_Axe>	maybe we could use use his rap talent
Mar 19 12:51:29 <lordofhaskel>	is it that guy who made a jailbreak for PS3?

Mar 19 13:06:59 <Paul_Axe>	I heard they like radio and electronic stuff
Mar 19 13:07:40 <Paul_Axe>	maybe we could simulate some kind of radio challenge?
Mar 19 13:08:12 <lordofhaskel>	yeah, we can even let them "win" it

Mar 19 13:11:23 <Paul_Axe>	afaik, all Korean teams are connected
Mar 19 13:12:40 <Paul_Axe>	things work different in Asia. I heard they even have some women hacker team
Mar 19 13:16:14 <Paul_Axe>	I suppose we should be careful and try not to mess with them
Mar 19 13:16:20 <Paul_Axe>	I've heard they have a strange way to count person's age in Korea. We should check the time/date configuration to prevent problems like Y2K
Mar 19 13:19:10 <Paul_Axe>	next, ufologists
Mar 19 13:20:30 <Paul_Axe>	those guys are from Taganrog
Mar 19 13:26:32 <lordofhaskel>	ufologists.. we could make an alien race in D'Errorim
Mar 19 13:27:04 <Paul_Axe>	well, this should work i suppose

Mar 19 13:29:50 <Paul_Axe>	one of them works for PT, by the way. Therefore, he won't participate in PHDays CTF this time, but maybe I can get him drunk and know something.
