PRISM Description
 
PRISM is a system for creating and maintaining custom virtual realities (VRs). A VR creator can suggest a life-like illusion of reality to target individuals. This enables the creator to ultimately manipulate targets' actions.
 
The common steps for using PRISM are:
1. to get information about targets (the more information, the better effect)
2. to describe a VR world using the PILL language
3. to load the PILL script to the PRISM control panel
4. PRISMë­?search engine will automatically localize targets
5. to launch PRISM to place all targets into the VR world (using a number of physical, biochemical, and technological methods)
6. the VR process can be stopped by some condition described in the PILL script or manually
