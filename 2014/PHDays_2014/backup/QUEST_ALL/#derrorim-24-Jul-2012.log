Jul 24 11:31:25 *	Now talking on #derrorim
Jul 24 11:31:25 *	pillow (pillow@unknown) has joined #derrorim
Jul 24 11:34:55 <ap0linand0r>	hi there
Jul 24 11:35:06 <lordofhaskel>	hi
Jul 24 11:35:21 <Paul_Axe>	hi. guys, this is ap0linand0r, he is our customer
Jul 24 11:36:36 <Paul_Axe>	ap0linand0r, as we planned we are ready to show our project
Jul 24 11:37:02 <ap0linand0r>	tell me some implementation details
Jul 24 11:37:43 <Paul_Axe>	our team has developed the framework to manipulate PRISM realities
Jul 24 11:39:14 <Paul_Axe>	it is based on Prism Illusion Layer Language, which can be used to describe the VR parameters
Jul 24 11:40:52 <Paul_Axe>	using it, you can define all the general rules for the new reality (e.g. physics laws, characters, their behaviors, moral principles etc)
Jul 24 11:41:53 <Paul_Axe>	it was developed by pillow
Jul 24 11:42:52 <Paul_Axe>	we also created the project D'Errorim using this framework
Jul 24 11:43:46 <Paul_Axe>	lordofhaskel, could you tell a bit about it?
Jul 24 11:47:27 <lordofhaskel>	well, at the moment we created the basic concepts... we thought that it would be interesting to simulate fantasy world which is populated with various creatures (e.g. orcs, angels, elves, etc)
Jul 24 11:48:46 <lordofhaskel>	as we want CTF players to attack infosec companies, we Julided to make reflected reality
Jul 24 11:50:15 <lordofhaskel>	companies will be represented as evil creatures, and all kinds of malware and hackers will be civilians
Jul 24 11:50:44 <Paul_Axe>	right, in this case we won't need to force hackers to do what we want, because they will think they are doing the right things
Jul 24 11:50:56 <lordofhaskel>	yeah
Jul 24 11:51:13 <ap0linand0r>	it's very interesting idea!
Jul 24 11:55:08 <lordofhaskel>	also we want to integrate Detcelfer as some kind of guide... it will be the first character met by players
Jul 24 11:56:37 <lordofhaskel>	so he will tell them story about evil villians that has to be destroyed by the chosen ones (CTF Players)
Jul 24 12:00:28 <Paul_Axe>	we still have to make some customizations 
Jul 24 12:01:59 <Paul_Axe>	PRISM developers say that the system works better if it is customized for each particular subject. PILL supports the feature to exploit weak points of every subject.
Jul 24 12:02:21 <pillow>	do we have this information?
Jul 24 12:16:05 <ap0linand0r>	paul can provide you with this informaion... he's got some connections
Jul 24 12:16:10 <Paul_Axe>	yes
Jul 24 12:17:35 <pillow>	PILL interpreter is still in beta
Jul 24 12:18:12 <pillow>	there are issues with dynamic methods and argument types
Jul 24 12:19:39 <pillow>	yesterday I caught a segmentation fault while trying to emulate some graphic environment on my BSD host
Jul 24 12:20:06 <lordofhaskel>	lol
Jul 24 12:20:56 <pillow>	but general things are working and tested
Jul 24 12:22:14 <lordofhaskel>	and I've got some bugs in terrain generator...  there's a deep hole in the center of derrorim and I can't understand why =\
Jul 24 12:23:18 <ap0linand0r>	he-he, I hope you'll fix everything!
Jul 24 12:23:30 <lordofhaskel>	be sure
Jul 24 12:23:52 <ap0linand0r>	ok, good luck
Jul 24 12:23:58 *	ap0linand0r (lordofhask@unknown) has left #derrorim (Leaving)
Jul 24 12:24:03 *	You have left channel #derrorim (Leaving)
