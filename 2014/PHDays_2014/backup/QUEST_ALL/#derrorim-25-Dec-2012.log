Dec 25 06:34:09 <lordofhaskel>	hi there
Dec 25 06:35:16 <lordofhaskel>	Paul, how are tests of derrorim in prism context?
Dec 25 06:35:35 <Paul_Axe>	hey
Dec 25 06:36:28 <Paul_Axe>	seems ok, the environment integrates seamlessly
Dec 25 06:37:11 <Paul_Axe>	the only thing i don't like is that only one person is able to look at it from inside
Dec 25 06:37:50 <lordofhaskel>	wow, i thought there would be a lot of bugs in real environment...)
Dec 25 06:38:23 <lordofhaskel>	what do you mean "look from inside"?
Dec 25 06:38:27 <Paul_Axe>	there were, but I have fixed almost all of them
Dec 25 06:39:27 <Paul_Axe>	there is a man in the PRISM team who can switch realities by his will
Dec 25 06:39:40 <lordofhaskel>	OMG
Dec 25 06:39:51 <Paul_Axe>	so he doesn't need PRISM to go into D'Errorim
Dec 25 06:40:00 <lordofhaskel>	i didn't know it's possible
Dec 25 06:40:13 <Paul_Axe>	seems like he is the only one who can do it
Dec 25 06:42:47 <lordofhaskel>	and when do we have the final testing?
Dec 25 06:44:27 <Paul_Axe>	We should finish PRISM-D'Errorim integration by the beginning of 2013
