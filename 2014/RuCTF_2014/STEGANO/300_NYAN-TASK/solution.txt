I actually didn't solve this problem by myself. 

quangntenemy first asked me to identify this image for stegano 300.

It looked fresh image, with 256x256.
my instinct came up thinking that it's a kind of barcode.
When I searched for different types of barcodes, I found out that this was "datamatrix"
by changing all the blue colors to black and other colors to white you will get the flag.
