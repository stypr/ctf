Since this CTF was based on Russia, I decided to find Russian google like "Yandex" and others and started to search for it.
After few hours, I found a russian-made social networking website called "VK" from Wikipedia.

After I searched for Olimpiada Balalaykina, I had found her profile successfully.
(Profile: http://vk.com/olimpiada_balalaykina)

If you see the image in her wall post, you see a bag with a lot of small words.

If you google search the image given in the wall post, you get a website containing the image of the bag.

"The extract from Pride and Prejudice features Mr Darcy¡¯s famous declaration of love to Elizabeth, and as such, makes a romantic gift for a loved one." can be found from the shopping website.
