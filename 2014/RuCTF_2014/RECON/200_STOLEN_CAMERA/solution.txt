It was very difficult task; there were only few images in the album category named "american trip".
I found some information from vk.com website, and the results were fantastic:

Here, we know that she was at Miami. Not only that, her american photos showed few hints.
Day 2 showed California.
Day 3 showed some place which looked like Nevada
Day 4 showed somewhere northern - Not sure where it was - but looked fresh in terms of its view (lucid sky and good mountain!) :)
Day 5 showed something related to farm - guessed Utah at first.

According to all these information, the place that she would have lost the photo could be somewhere between Miami and California.

It had been looked like that she was going from West to East, I started to guess cities near Utah, and guessed it would be somewhere in Colorado.
then I started to brute-force by hand the all cities in Colorado...

and I found "Grand Junction" as the answer.

PS: you know, guessing is also a type of social hacking. :p
