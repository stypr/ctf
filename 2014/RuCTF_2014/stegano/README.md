## NYAN-TASK (300pt)

I actually didn't solve this problem by myself. 

one of our team member `quangntenemy` first asked me to identify this image for stegano 300.

It looked like a fresh image with 256x256 at first sight.

Anyways, my instinct came up to let me think that it's a kind of barcode.

When I searched for different types of barcodes, I found out that this was about the `datamatrix`.

by changing all blue colors to black and other colors to white you will be able to get the flag.
